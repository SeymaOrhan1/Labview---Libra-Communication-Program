# Labview---Libra-Communication-Program
I did this project during my TÜBİTAK-UME internship experience.

This is a simulation program that communicates with the Vibra-HT Libra in Labview program. The results of the measurements made on the libra were taken with the program in a synchronized manner, and the obtained values and calculations (standard deviation and mean) were recorded in a .txt file one after the other.
